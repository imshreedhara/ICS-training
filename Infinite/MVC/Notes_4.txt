Model Validations: Are a means to validate data at the server side. 
In Asp.Net MVC, we can do server side validations on the model using Data Annotations.
Data Anotation is a namespace that provides various attribute classes, which define metadata for controls.
-So we decorate the properties of the Model with these attribute classes
-Some attribute classes are
  Required
  RegularExpression
  Range
  DataType
  EmailAddress
  Phone
  StringLength
-In case we need to do custom validations of a control, then we can create our own custom validation attribute
